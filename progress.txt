1) Install Expo client on your device, create-react-native-app (CRNA) and react-native-cli on your machine
https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app

Some erros has occurred before the launching of the CRNA, but suggestions from helped me to solve them out
I used QR code, just like in the example, to add the app into the Expo client
At this point livereload was already working on my phone (iOS)

2) But how can I watch my app running on Android device, without having the physical one?
It took a lot of time for me as for JS developer, but I've found out, that Android Studio is the moust stable way
to work with Expo. It takes a lot of time to set all stuff up, so it's beter to make sure, thay you have working
Android SDK Device Simulator on your machine

3) At this moment we can start coding. Make sure that you have Node 10+ installed.
Othervise it can cause some unexpected problems.
The index file is App.js, at our index folder
As you may allready know, React Native uses JSX, just like React JS. But there are some defferenses.
Frankly speaking, there are not as much of them, as between HTML and JSX attributes names.
'View' instead of 'div' for example. And you can reassign all this stuff btw
 
4) The first library that I've started to use is react-native-elements.
It's very usefull set of different UI elements, which looks likes native ones on each OS
