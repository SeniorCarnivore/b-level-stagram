1) Install Expo client on your device, create-react-native-app (CRNA) and react-native-cli on your machine

Some erros was oquted before the launching of the CRNA, but suggestions from helped me to solve them out
I used QR code, just like in the example, to add the app into the Expo client
At this point live was allready working on your phone (iOS)

2) But how can I watch my app running on Android device, without having the physical one?
It was easy to find out, that react-native-cli can eject project for Android studio with 'react-native run-android' command

3) At this moment we can start coding. Make sure that you have Node 10+ install.
Othervise it can cause some unexpected problems.
The index file is App.js, at our index folder
As you may allready know, React Native uses JSX, just like React JS. But there are some defferenses.
Frankly speaking, there are not as much of them, as between HTML and JSX attributes names.
'View' instead of 'div' for example. And you can reassign all this stuff btw
 
4) The first library that I've started to use is react-native-elements.
It's very usefull set of different UI elements, which looks likes native ones on each OS
